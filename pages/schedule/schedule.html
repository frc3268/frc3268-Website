      During the off-season, a period from <strong>September to December and April to June</strong>, we 
      meet on <strong>Mondays after school</strong> and <strong> during Viking Time(maybe after 
      school)</strong>. Our after-school meetings end when the activity bus comes. Our Viking Time 
      meetings end when Viking Time does. <strong>The activity bus comes at 4:20 and leaves at 
      4:25. On Wednesday, it is at 3:05 P.M.</strong></p>

      <!--Feel like we should update this but whatever-->
      From January until the start of Spring break, we are in Build Season, which is a fancy 
      way of saying that we meet more often. This means that we are going to meet <strong>EVERY 
      DAY</strong> except the weekends. You donâ€™t have to stay for that long during build season but 
      it will be helpful.
