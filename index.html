          After a months-long offseason build, we have finally completed our version of swerve, and just in time for kickoff! During the process, we welcomed dozens of new members, learned the ropes of a new drive system, and, perhaps most impactfully of all, moved into a new, much more spacious room. Some say the most valuable part was the friends we made along the way, but we think the spinning and moving at the same time is pretty cool.

          Wow, it’s been a while. We haven’t been able to post updates about our innovative progress during build season, but we assure you the there has been progress nonetheless. This year, we attended two competitions: one at Glacier Peak Highschool, and one at Auburn Highschool. For Glacier Peak, which was a week 1 event,we constructed an arm with a claw-style grabber at the end to pick up and score cones/cubes into the goals. Unfortunately, repeated failures with the arm’s mechanishsms,as well as issues with the drivetrain, caused us to place 31st, out of 34 teams at the event, and we came back to Inglemoor at the end of that weekend with a hunger for improvement. Throughout the 4 weeks we had until the Auburn competition, we worked to make the robot more focused, efficient, and productive. We were able to, with the help of other teams(Thank you CPR #3663),compete competently at the Auburn event, placing 15th out of 31 teams-a halfway jump up the ranking ladder! Additionally, we gratefully accepted Mustang Mechanica(6076)’s gracious offer to join the 8th alliance in playoffs as their first selection, along with the Golden Gators(8303). For the first time since 2019, we had been chosen for a playoff alliance. Our alliance played valiantly, but was eliminated in semifinals due to some mild skill issues on the charge station. Even still, we are glad to have to opportunity to compete in the playoffs, and we are excited for what the future will bring.

          Finally! FRC Charged Up has released, with an interesting stack-and-sort game involving cones and inflatable blocks and an easy balance endgame. We don’t have the stuff for swerve this year, so tank seems like a solid option - that, with a simple gripper for both items, should hopefully be solid at competition. Our hopes were however dashed at kickoff when, after 113 years of anticipation, the FRC announced that “Water Game” would not be played in 2023.
