make open sans (the font of the original webpage) work
it's not an issue with the css file since comic sans ms worked, and open sans works on the other page, so idk the problem

This is likely the fact that chrome and other browsers dont support it by default, we will likely need to import the font into this repository then use it in css. -Manny

ps. At least i think so


Scroll is broken slightly I thought it might be margin but idk -Manny
